# Flatiron School Phase-2 Project: Monterey Pub Website Single Page React Application

### Overview
Monterey Pub is small bar and restaurant located in the Pittsburgh neighborhood, the Mexican War Streets.  This single page React application can function as a rudimentary website to communicate information such as the menu and contact details.

### Application Requirements
* Use of Json Servers
* Internet Browser (optimized for Google Chrome)

### Installation
* Fork and Clone this repository
* Navigated to newly cloned directory in your terminal
* Install all necessary packages using command <npm install>
* Activate the json server using command <npm run server>
* Start up the application in another terminal using command <npm start>

### Using Monterey Pub's Website
When the application is started the user is directed to the home page where they can learn a little about the pub and see its business hours.  The user can then navigate to the components of Food, Drinks, or Contact us by clicking their respective links in the navigation bar located at the top of the application.  The food and drink pages display the respective menu, while the contact us page will direct the user to our Instagram when they click the link.  The user will also be able to join the pub's email list, with new users being appended to the DOM to show you are part of the squad.

#### Content Ownership Details
I currently work at Monterey Pub and am permitted to use all menu information and pictures by Pub Inc in Pittsburgh, PA.
